This project explores the use of deep learning techniques for the automated classification of blood cancer from high-resolution microscopic images. It evaluates the performance of three advanced models—Swin Transformer, ConvNeXt, and EfficientNetV2—for detecting leukemia subtypes like ALL and AML, as well as distinguishing them from healthy cells. The study emphasizes clinical interpretability using Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM for explainable AI.
